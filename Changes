Revision history for Perl module WebService::BambooHR

0.06 2016-02-02 NEILB
    - Added company_report() method, which is used to get the data behind
      a custom report in Bamboo.
    - The changed_employees() method had stopped working, because Bamboo
      had started return JSON, where previously I'd been getting XML.
      Have hopefully also made the test for this method ignore any future
      edits in the Bamboo test company.
    - changed_employees() now returns the changes in date order from oldest
      to most recent.
    - Now use JSON::MaybeXS rather than JSON.

    - The changed-employees test was failing, because the test account
      had been changed again. Hopefully won't happen again, otherwise
      I'll change what the test does.

0.03 2014-02-13 NEILB
    - List all field names in Employee fields
    - Added pseudo fields for selfServiceAccess, terminationType,
      and terminationReason. These can only be accessed in the API
      itself via field numbers.
